## Introduction

Project idea is clean and high-quality code.
Unlike most (all at the moment) implementations, like [webonyx](https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php), 
[youshido](https://github.com/youshido-php/GraphQL) or [digitalonline](https://github.com/digiaonline/graphql-php) 
the Railt contains a completely own implementation of the GraphQL SDL parser 
which is based on [EBNF-like grammar](https://github.com/railt/railt/tree/1.4.x/resources/graphql). This opportunity 
allows not only to have the [original implementation of the language](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/) and to 
keep it always up to date, but also to implement [a new backward compatible 
functionality](https://github.com/railt/railt/projects/1) that is not available 
to other implementations.

Goal of Railt:
- Do not repeat the mistakes made in the JS-based implementations.
- Implement a modern and convenient environment for PHP developers.
- Implement easy integration into any ready-made solutions based on PSR.
- Provide familiar functionality (including dependency injection, routing, etc.).

## Installation

Via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

- Add into your `composer.json`:
```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "post-autoload-dump": [
            "Railt\\Discovery\\Manifest::discover"
        ]
    }
}
```

- `composer require railt/railt`

## Quick Start

Let's create our first GraphQL schema!

```graphql
schema {
    query: Example
}

type Example {
    say(message: String = "Hello"): String! 
        @route(action: "ExampleController@say")
}
```

In order to return the correct answer from the `say` field let's create an 
`ExampleController` controller with the desired method `say`.

```php
class ExampleController
{
    public function say(string $message): string
    {
        return $message;
    }
}
```

That's all we need to know ðŸš€

But I think we should still run the application. For the [Symfony](https://github.com/railt/symfony-bundle) 
and [Laravel](https://github.com/railt/laravel-provider) there are appropriate 
packages, but if you do not use (or do not want to use) frameworks, it is not 
difficult to do it from scratch.

The `index.php` is the main file that handles all requests to the application. 
So let's create it and write a simple logic:

```php
<?php
use Phplrt\Io\File;
use Railt\Http\Factory;
use Railt\Foundation\Application;
use Railt\Http\Provider\GlobalsProvider;

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

// Creating a new Application in debug mode information
// about which is passed in the first argument.
$app = new Application(true);

// Create a connection
$connection = $app->connect(File::fromPathname(__DIR__ . '/schema.graphqls'));

// Processing of HTTP Request
$responses = $connection->request(Factory::create(new GlobalsProvider()));

// And send the HTTP Response
$responses->send();
```

...send request

```graphql
{
    say(message: "Something is awesome!")
}
```

...and get the answer!

```json
{
    "say": "Something is awesome!"
}
```

That's how simple it is ðŸŽˆ
